# Lebron-Kobe
A data visualization project to compare clutch stats of Kobe and Lebron

Data Chosen: the data I chose contains all the advance data of clutch performance for both Lebron James and Kobe Bryant. It will help us to visualize their clutch performance directly. 

Why this problem is important: This problem is important because it’s been one of the most popular debates for all basketball fans for over a decade. As a 15 years NBA fan without really being a fan of anyone, but just love the game itself, my perspective shouldn’t be biased but in an engaging manner instead.
